## Get Started

A few resources to get started, if this is your first React/Tailwind CSS Project -

- [Tailwind CSS - Guide for CSS components](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [VITE - Local development server for React Projects](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [React - Open-source front-end JavaScript library](https://react.dev/)
- [Icon Pack - Useful icons packge for React Projects](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/)
- [Fonts - Useful Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)


### NOTE - This project was developed as a practice exercise for using Tailwind CSS, a CSS framework. It will soon be expanded into a full-stack application with integrated databases and backend APIs.
